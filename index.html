    <h1>About Me, LLove Creator</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <h2>
      <p>
        I am Leslie Love, a visual artist exploring the digital realm. My
        multimedia works often combine nostalgic family imagery, found,
        thrifted, gifted, and natural handmade materials. The medium informs and
        inspires my art, as I leave wood grain, flaws, and unique qualities of
        materials exposed, revealing my concept and process. My work depicts
        connections and relationships between people and demonstrates my deep
        love and respect for the environment.

      <p>
        A have created a couple of websites for my artwork using templates in
        WordPress, and more recently in WIX. I have never coded from scratch
        like this.

    <h2>What are your goals for this course?</h2>
    <h2>
      <p>
        I'm taking DGL 103 to contribute to the Web Design Fundamentals
        Certificate. I'd love to keep my A+ streak going, in hopes I will
        receive a scholarship if I am accepted into Emily Carr University's Low
        Residency Masters Program. I am applying this Fall.
